# Libft - My C Standard Library
Implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions plus some Additional Functions.

### What is libft?
Libft is an individual project at [42](https://www.42sp.org.br) that requires us to re-create some [C standard library](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/index.htm) functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

#### Objectives

- Imperative programming

## Getting started
**Follow the steps below**
```bash
# Clone the project and access the folder
git clone https://github.com/darlen-silva/libft-42sp
cd libft-42sp/
# Run Make so you can build the library
make
# Run Make with bonus if you want chained lists manipulation functions
make bonus
# Compile your main with the library, example:
# Include the header "libft.h" in the file.
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o main main.c -L. -lft
# Execute your program
./main
# Clean output objects with
make fclean
# Well done!
```
